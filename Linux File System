               Linux file system is a built-in layer of a Linux operating system. It helps to handle the data management of the storage, to arrange the files on the disk storage,
	       and manage the file name, file size, creation date and so many other information about a file.
							 
	       The main difference between the windows and linux file system is to understand where the root of the file system begins. In Windows, the root begins at the drive letter, 
	       usually C:\, which basically means it begins at the hard drive. In linux however, the root of the filesystem does not correnpond with a physical device or location, It is a
	       logical location of simply "/".
