    Linux is a multiuser system, this means more than one person can interact with the same system at the same time.
    Group is a collection of users.
    
    sakshi : X : 1000 : 1000 : sakshi chougule : /home/sakshi : /bin/blash
    Here , sakshi = username
           X = password
           1000 = UID
           1000 =GID
           sakshi chougule = real name 
           /home/sakshi = home directory
           /bin/blash = shell program
       
       
Some basic command for users and groups :
    useradd = This command is used to create a new user
            eg. useradd sakshi
    cat/etc/passwd = To see the user is created or not
    userdel = To delete the user account.

    usermod = To make changes to an existing user or group.
              uermod -aG [group] [user]
              eg. if we want to add the user sakshi in the group students then use this command usermod 
              usermod -aG students sakshi
    id sakshi = To see the information about user and group.
