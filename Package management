Package Management :
			Package management is a system by which software can be installed, updated, queried or removed from a filesystem.
			At the lowest level of the Debian package management system is the 'dpkg' command.
			This command can be tricky for novice Linux users, so the Advanced Package Tool,
			'apt-get', a front-end program to the 'dpkg' tool, makes management of packages even easier.
			similarly for CentOS package management 'rpm' is low level tool and 'yum' high level tool is used.
			and for openSUSE package management 'rpm' is low level tool and 'zypper' high level tool is used.
										
			dpkg :
				dpkg is a low-level package manager for Debian-based systems. 
				It can install, remove, provide information about and build *.deb packages but it can’t automatically download
				and install their corresponding dependencies.									
			apt-get :
				apt-get is a high-level package manager for Debian and derivatives, and provides a simple way to retrieve and install packages,
				including dependency resolution, from multiple sources using the command line. 
				Unlike dpkg, apt-get does not work directly with *.deb files, but with the package proper name.
										
									
		
Commands :
	ssh = ssh stands for “Secure Shell”. It is a protocol used to securely connect to a remote server/system.
	ssh is secure in the sense that it transfers the data in encrypted form between the host and the client.
	It transfers inputs from the client to the host and relays back the output. 
	syntax : ssh user_name@host(IP/Domain_name)
